# boundary_id (Find boundary)

boundary_id is a Python project that print out the boundary ID (BND_ID) for a location point. If the location point is not in any boundary, it will print out "Out of boundary".

## Details

- Input : location latlong (x, y)
- Boundary information : BND ID and polygon shape from shapefile
- Output : BND_ID / "Out of boundry"

# nearest_dp (Find the nearest DP)

nearest_dp is a Python project that print out the nearest DP for a location point. 

## Details

- Input : latlong (x, y)
- Boundary information : DP latlong (x, y)
- Output : DP_ID
